# Prepare Authorize Issuers

Prepare an unsigned XDR transaction to authorize multiple issuers in a vault.

## POST `/tx/prepare/authorize_issuers`

See [Vault Authorize Issuers](../vault/authorize-issuers.md) for complete documentation.

This endpoint prepares the transaction that can be signed and submitted via `/vault/authorize_issuer` (uses the same endpoint as single issuer authorization).
