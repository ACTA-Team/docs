# Focus and Current Purpose

ACTA is a verifiable credentials infrastructure built for startups. Our focus is to make credentials impossible to fake and simple to verify.

- Built on Stellar (Soroban) with public on‑chain state and encrypted off‑chain storage
- Issue W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 and store them in the holder’s Vault
- Fast integrations via REST API and TypeScript SDK
- Designed for teams like GrantFox, TrustlessWork, KindFi, OfferHub, and more

Outcomes

- Instant public verification without calling a third party
- Reduced fraud and disputes through public hashes
- Stateless apps: store only `vc_id` and rely on ACTA for storage and verification
